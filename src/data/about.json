  "history": [
    "The journey of JEC Chess Club began with the vision of a group of skilled strategists, led by Priyam Pratim Das (Founding Member & First Coordinator) along with batchmates Samarjyoti Deka (Mech 2007–11) and Shekhar Limbu (CSE 2007–11). Until PHOENIX 2010, JEC had no official chess club, and chess was just a casual pastime during the techno-cultural fest. Inspired by their victories in local tournaments and a strong showing at regional competitions, they decided to form a dedicated club to cultivate a culture of chess excellence. To attract members, they first organized a two-day workshop on advanced chess openings and strategies. Despite having no funds, the team promoted the event across hostels and nearby institutes, eventually gathering 58 enthusiastic participants. With the support of Dr. Atul Bora, Principal of JEC, the workshop was successfully held on 31st March 2011, marking the official birth of the JEC Chess Club, complete with club ID cards and scorebooks issued to participants.",
    "Building on this success, the team set their focus on competitive play and collaborated with a regional chess master to conduct another two-day workshop on advanced endgame techniques. Without funds for publicity or hospitality, they arranged accommodation for the guest in Hostel 7 and designed their own event posters. With the support of their batchmates and permission from Dr. Atul Bora, they registered over 60 participants, and on 30th April 2011, organized the 'Checkmate Champions' Workshop. Students delved into complex endgame theory and even received premium chess sets. These workshops laid the foundation of the club, which thrived with in-house tournaments and study sessions. At the end of the 2010–11 session, the leadership was handed over to Pranab Deka (CSE, H-1) as Coordinator, Dwanel Barman (Elec, H-7) as First Joint Coordinator, and Dipankar Bora (CSE, H-7) as Second Joint Coordinator. Priyam Pratim Das extended his heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Atul Bora, their chess mentor, teammates Samarjyoti Deka and Shekhar Limbu, the core team of 2010–11, and the boarders of Hostel 7 for their help in promoting the workshops. What started as a dream turned into a reality, and today, the JEC Chess Club continues its journey of sharing strategic knowledge and fostering chess talent at Jorhat Engineering College."
